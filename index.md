4. Next type in the following, replacing the zz with the letters in your course specific account.

5. You will be prompted with a yes/no question. It is okay to type yes and press enter the first time you log into a server. However if you get a message like this when logging into a server you log into often then that could mean someone may be hacking your server account.
6. Enter your password
7. You are now logged into the server. It will look like the following.
